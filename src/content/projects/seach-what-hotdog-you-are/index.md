I was sent a link to an instagram site where I could find what hotdog I was.
But on Instagram you cannot search by plaintext comments!
Was I really expected to scroll through the entire published body of work to find what hotdog I was?

Instead of wasting my time, I pieced together a simple Instagram post indexer with Python and Selenium, then dumped the resulting json data into a searchable site.

Now, countless generations will be able to search for what hot dog they are.
